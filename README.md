This project aims to build an Automatic Text Translation application, combining both natural language processing and machine translation technology. The reason for choosing the topic is to improve the ability to communicate and access multilingual information, while taking advantage of modern technologies to help users save time and effort in translating and understanding text content.
Goal: Build an application that automatically translates text from a source language to a target language, while also providing auxiliary features such as sentiment analysis, content search, and conversion text to speech
Scope: Focus on developing simple desktop applications, supporting text translation from English to Vietnamese and vice versa, using modern natural language processing and machine translation technologies.
*Using the Transformers deep learning model, LSTM:
The use of deep learning transformers and LSTM models brings many important benefits to language translation applications. First, these models are often highly efficient at translating languages ​​thanks to being trained on large amounts of data. Their effectiveness is also reflected in their flexible multilingual translation capabilities, which reduces the time and effort required for multilingual translation application development.
